# SGrite
alternative approch based strict gradual pattern ,base on grite algoritthn,and finding maximal frequent pattern

# Itemset
* this repository,save works on the extraction algorithm of gradual pattern on a Dataset
* based of maximal frequent set.
## List of files

   * Grite.java
   * Tools.java
   * config.dat
   * transa.dat
   * README(this file)


* The dataset used for test is **transa.dat** and **config.dat**, Which contain respectively the test database and the second for the moment in the first line the number of transactions used, in second row the number of items.
* 
## Usage

To run the program with dataset provided and default values for **threshold = 0.2**
* usage multiple dataset ,and generate different parameter,number of transaction,number of item 
## Using Java IDE
	
* Create new projet and three main class named Tools.java and Grite.java and GriteStrict.java , main class.
* used grite algorithm based on strict operator {<,>}
